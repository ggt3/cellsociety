##Peer Code Review Recitation

* I worked with Cat (Team 3) to determine which part of the code to refactor. I worked a lot on the 
View, so I decided to refactor a method from that class that I hadn't refactored yet. Many of the sections
with duplicated code were between the View method and ButtonBox, which is because I am in the process of moving
the creation of buttons from being created in the View class to an outside class called ButtonBox (so at this point
it is almost identical, but code from both won't be used in the end). The section in my code that I decided to refactor
was 2 methods that added and formatted text when it was added to the Scene.

* There were two methods in the View class with different parameters called addText()-- one of which allows the user to addText 
and put it in a specific location in the grid and the other one that did not take a location. The initial reasoning for this was 
that when adding to the main scene, I needed to specify location. However, within the popUp window to load a file, the text was already 
set in the grid pane, making it unnecessary to to set a location.

* Cat and I considered the idea of making 1 method, and extracting the line that altered the location of the text (since the 
methods were otherwise identical). After discussing more, we realized that we could put the locations as (0,0) for when we didn't want to
relocate, and we could completely delete the method with no location parameters. This way it will be more convenient to add text 
in the future.
